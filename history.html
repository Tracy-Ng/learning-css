            <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

            <p>"Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages.
                They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously
                could only be defined in a page's HTML.</p>

            <p>CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining
                the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be
                defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used
                by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages
                at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for
                fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to
                be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.</p>

            <p>While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page
                layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style,
                thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web
                developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages
                today incorporate cascading style sheets."</p>

            <h2>History of CSS</h2>

            <p>Like HTML, CSS is standardized by the W3 consortium. CSS is an open, independent and freely usable
                standard. As with HTML, a working group exists for CSS who concerns itself with development of the
                standard. This is being done in accordance with W3C rules.</p>

            <p>CSS comes in different versions. CSS level 1 was released in 1996, and republished with corections in
                1999. CSS level 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS level 1. CSS level 2 adds support for different
                output media. CSS 3 is currently in development and will be split up in modules.</p>

            <p>The idea behind it was to seperate presentation and content of a web site. The advantage of this approach
                is that updates and changes to the presentation need only be applied once (to the stylesheet) to affect
                all pages. Especially large sites can achieve significant time savings. In order to enforce this
                separation of concerns, the W3C has deprecated the "font" tag in HTML 4. Newer (X)HTML versions will
                deprecate other tags in a similar vein.</p>

            <p>CSS stylesheets are an immediate addition to HTML. CSS is a language to define format properties of HTML
                or XML tags. HTML has reached the end of it's shelf life and is not being developed further. XHTML is
                the new standard instead. XHTML reformulates HTML with XML syntax while at the same time getting rid of
                presentational markup. XHTML only contains content, presentation is the domain of a CSS stylesheet. This
                allows for different stylesheets for different output formats such as print, aural or small devices.
                Search machines on the other hand have an easier job if they are only presented with content markup."

                <h3>CSS 1</h3>
                <p>The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published in
                    December 1996. Among its capabilities are support for</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Font properties such as typeface and emphasis</li>
                    <li>Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements</li>
                    <li>Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text</li>
                    <li>Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements</li>
                    <li>Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements</li>
                    <li>Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-column">
                <h3>CSS 2</h3>

                <p>CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a Recommendation in May 1998. A
                    superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed
                    positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets and
                    bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows. The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2
                    recommendation.</p>
                <p>CSS level 2 revision 1 or CSS 2.1 fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly-supported or not fully
                    interoperable features and adds already-implemented browser extensions to the specification. In
                    order to
                    comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth
                    between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first
                    became a
                    Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on June 13,
                    2005
                    for further review. It was returned to Candidate Recommendation status on 19 July 2007 and was
                    updated
                    twice in 2009. However, since changes and clarifications were made to the prose it went back to Last
                    Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010. Later it went into Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011.
                    It
                    was published as a Recommendation on 7 June 2011.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-column">
                <h3>CSS 3</h3>

                <p>Instead of defining all features in a single, large specification like CSS 2, CSS 3 is divided into
                    several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capability or extends features
                    defined
                    in CSS 2, over preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of
                    publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June
                    1999.
                </p>

                <p>Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and are in different status. As
                    of
                    March 2011, there are over 40 CSS modules published from the CSS Working Group. Some modules such as
                    Selectors, Namespaces, Color and Media Queries are considered stable and are either in Candidate
                    Recommendation or Proposed Recommendation status. Once CSS 2.1 is finalized and published as
                    Recommendation, they are likely to go to Recommendation as well.</p>

                <p>On 7 June 2011, the CSS 3 Color Module was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
